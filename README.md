# Voronoi Diagram Calculator

This is my part of a group project for an Algorithms class in Spring 2024 where we figured out different ways to calculate a Voronoi Diagram with certain time complexities.

A Voronoi Diagram is a diagram consisting of cells (Voronoi cells) surrounding each point c in which c is the closest center point to every point in that cell. Calculating this diagram is considered an NP-hard problem.

For our purposes we focused on the version where:
- We are in a 2-d plane
- Euclidean distance is our distance metric
- There are no collinear points
